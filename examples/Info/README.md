# Info Examples

[日本語はこちら](README.ja.md)

Info examples focus on helpers that print build/runtime configuration details so you can verify Arduino-ESP32 board settings on hardware.

- **BoardSettings (`EspHelperBoardSettings.h`)** – dump USB, CPU, flash, PSRAM, and partition scheme settings to Serial at startup. (Sketch: [BoardSettings/BoardSettings.ino](BoardSettings/BoardSettings.ino))

See `BoardSettings/` for the example sketch.
